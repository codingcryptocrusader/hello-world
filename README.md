Code:You
Hello, my name is Tyler Ballard. I began a love for coding during the pandemic. 
Found a nice WFH job, but are only able to do minimum tasks due to lack of knowledge. 
I'm very interested in Robotics and started taking classes at Harvard last year learning computer science.
My motives for Code You is to learn Coding and become more efficent by getting hands on experience.
I'm also a certified nutritionist with a private practice as well as working at a local non profit mentoring young kids and adults.
